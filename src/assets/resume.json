    {
      "par1": "I am a teacher, writer and researcher based in the Department of English at Stellenbosch University. My work explores the intersection of social and ecological issues in literary texts. Currently, I am working on a book project that investigates alternative temporalities in a range of Southern African novels.",
      "par2": "When I can find the time, I love writing short stories, and I try never to be too far away from the sea. Not too long ago, I completed a web development course (mostly JS/React, with some Java added for spice). Among other things, this page is an attempt to keep some of those coding skills alive :-)",
