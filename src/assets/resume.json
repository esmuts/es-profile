    {
      "par1": "I am a lecturer in the Department of English at Stellenbosch University. My work considers the intersection of social and ecological issues in literary texts, focusing especially on postcolonial writing. My current long-term research project explores alternative temporalities in a range of novels by Southern African writers, including Zoë Wicomb, Bessie Head, Nadine Gordimer, Imraan Coovadia, and J.M. Coetzee. Some of my recent writing has appeared in Social Dynamics, English Studies in Africa, Daily Maverick and the Johannesburg Review of Books.",
      "par2": "When I can find the time, I love writing short stories, and I try to never be too far away from the sea.",
